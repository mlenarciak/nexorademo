## Overview

The amenity system in Nexora works on three levels: property-wide, room category, and individual room. This hierarchy allows for efficient management while providing flexibility for unique offerings.

## Amenity Levels

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Property Level">
    **Property Amenities** apply to all rooms by default
    
    Examples:
    - WiFi throughout property
    - Free parking
    - Swimming pool
    - Gym/fitness center
    - Restaurant
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Category Level">
    **Category Amenities** apply to all rooms in that category
    
    Examples:

    - Balcony (suite categories)
    - Kitchen (apartment categories)
    - Bathtub (deluxe categories)
  </Tab>

The amenity selector provides a searchable, multi-select interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Select Amenities">
    Open the amenity selector dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse by Category">
    Amenities are grouped by category (Room Features, Bathroom, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search">
    Type to filter amenities by name
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Multiple">
    Click to select/deselect amenities
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Selection">
    Selected amenities appear as badges below the dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove">
    Click the Ã— on any badge to remove that amenity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Amenities

Create property-specific amenities not in the standard library:

```typescript
import { createAmenity } from '@/app/actions/amenities';

await createAmenity({
  name: "Rooftop Jacuzzi",
  i18nKey: "amenity.custom.rooftop_jacuzzi",
  category: "CUSTOM",
  icon: "waves",
  description: "Private rooftop jacuzzi with city views"
});
```

<Info>
Custom amenities are added to your library and can be reused across all properties in your organization.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assign at the Right Level" icon="layer-group">
    - **Property Level**: Amenities ALL rooms have (WiFi, parking)
    - **Category Level**: Amenities specific to room type (balcony for suites)
    - **Room Level**: Unique features (corner unit, renovated)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep It Accurate" icon="check-circle">
    Only list amenities that are actually available. Incorrect amenity listings lead to guest complaints.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Standard Names" icon="tag">
    Stick to the predefined amenities when possible for consistency and translation support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add Icons" icon="image">
    Icons help guests quickly identify amenities at a glance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Amenity Display

### To Guests

Amenities are displayed during booking:

```tsx
// Combined amenities shown to guests
const displayedAmenities = [
  { name: "WiFi", source: "property" },
  { name: "Air Conditioning", source: "category" },
  { name: "Sea View", source: "room" }
];
```

### Source Indicators

When viewing internally, amenities show their source:

- **Property** (light badge) - Inherited from property
- **Category** (secondary badge) - Inherited from category
- **Room** (primary badge) - Specific to this room

## Server Actions

### Get All Amenities

```typescript
import { getAmenities } from '@/app/actions/amenities';

const result = await getAmenities();

if (result.success) {
  const amenities = result.data;
  // Amenities grouped by category
}
```

### Get Room's Combined Amenities

```typescript
import { getRoomAmenities } from '@/app/actions/amenities';

const result = await getRoomAmenities(roomId);

if (result.success) {
  // Returns combined amenities from property + category + room
  // Each amenity includes its source for transparency
  const amenities = result.data;
}
```

### Assign Amenities to Room

```typescript
import { assignAmenitiesToRoom } from '@/app/actions/amenities';

await assignAmenitiesToRoom(
  roomId,
  [amenityId1, amenityId2, amenityId3]
);
```

## Multilingual Support

Amenities support multiple languages via the i18n system:

```json
{
  "en": {
    "amenity.wifi": "WiFi",
    "amenity.ac": "Air Conditioning",
    "amenity.balcony": "Balcony"
  },
  "it": {
    "amenity.wifi": "WiFi",
    "amenity.ac": "Aria Condizionata",
    "amenity.balcony": "Balcone"

  "pt": {
    "amenity.wifi": "WiFi",
    "amenity.ac": "Ar Condicionado",
    "amenity.balcony": "Varanda"
  }
}
```
