## Overview

Individual Rooms are specific units within a Room Category. While they inherit settings from their category, each room can have unique attributes like room number, floor, and specific amenities.

## Creating Rooms

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Category">
    Navigate to your property's room categories and select the category where you want to add rooms
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Room">
    Click the "+ Add Room" button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Basic Details">
    <ParamField path="number" type="string" required>
      Room number or name (e.g., "101", "Ocean Suite A")
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField path="floor" type="string">
      Floor number or level (e.g., "1", "Ground", "Mezzanine")
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField path="bookable" type="boolean" default={true}>
      Whether the room can be booked online
    </ParamField>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Override Settings (Optional)">
    Override category defaults if this specific room differs:
    - Custom capacity
    - Different bed configuration
    - Specific amenities
    - Special CIN code
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Room Status

Rooms can be in different operational states:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Available" icon="check-circle">
    Ready for booking and occupancy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Occupied" icon="user">
    Currently occupied by guests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cleaning" icon="sparkles">
    Being cleaned between guests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maintenance" icon="wrench">
    Under maintenance, not bookable
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blocked" icon="ban">
    Manually blocked from bookings
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Maintenance Mode

Put rooms into maintenance mode with date ranges:

```typescript
{
  maintenanceMode: true,
  maintenanceFrom: "2025-12-20",
  maintenanceTo: "2025-12-27",
  maintenanceNote: "Annual deep cleaning and bathroom renovation"
}
```

<Info>
Rooms in maintenance mode are automatically blocked from bookings and show as unavailable on the calendar.
</Info>

## Category Inheritance

Rooms automatically inherit from their category:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Room Category] -->|Name| B[All Rooms]
    A -->|Capacity| B
    A -->|Bed Config| B
    A -->|Amenities| B
    A -->|Policies| B
    C[Individual Room] -->|Can Override| D[Specific Settings]
```

### What's Inherited

- âœ… Capacity settings
- âœ… Bed configurations
- âœ… Amenities
- âœ… Pet and smoking policies
- âœ… Size and description

### What Can Be Overridden

Individual rooms can customize:
- ðŸ”§ Capacity (if this specific room differs)
- ðŸ”§ Bed configuration
- ðŸ”§ Amenities (add or remove)
- ðŸ”§ CIN code (if required per room)

## Room-Specific Amenities

Add amenities unique to this room:

```typescript
// Category has: WiFi, AC, TV
// This room adds: Balcony, Sea View

roomAmenities = [
  ...categoryAmenities,  // Inherited
  "Balcony",             // Room-specific
  "Sea View"             // Room-specific
]
```

<Tip>
The amenity system combines property-level, category-level, and room-level amenities automatically.
</Tip>

## Bulk Operations

Update multiple rooms at once:

```typescript
import { bulkUpdateRooms } from '@/app/actions/rooms';

await bulkUpdateRooms(
  ["room_1", "room_2", "room_3"],
  {
    floor: "2",
    bookable: true,
    status: "AVAILABLE"
  }
);
```

<Warning>
Bulk operations affect all selected rooms. Double-check your selection before applying changes.
</Warning>
