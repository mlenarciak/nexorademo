Welcome to the running log of features that are being rebuilt for Nexora. Each entry summarizes the modernized workflow and calls out when the surface is still under construction.

## License Management

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Licenza

Nexora will provide a centralized license registry that captures property license numbers, issuing authorities, and renewal cadence per accommodation. The placeholder surface in the application ensures navigation parity while the full workflow—notifications, document storage, and compliance auditing—is delivered.

- Track license metadata per property or brand
- Schedule renewal reminders with escalation paths
- Attach supporting compliance documentation for quick audits

<Info>
The new experience is shipping incrementally. Until the full workflow is ready, admins should continue to maintain official records in their existing system.

## Release Changelog

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Changelog Scidoo

Nexora will surface a unified change history so every department understands what has shipped and how it affects day-to-day operations. The rebuilt experience will allow filtering by module, tagging properties impacted by critical fixes, and exporting snapshots for regulatory reviews.

- Curated release notes with module and severity filters
- Organization-focused highlights that call out relevant updates
- Digest emails and RSS feeds for department leads

## Company Switcher

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Cambia azienda

Enterprise customers frequently manage multiple legal entities or properties. The refreshed company switcher will streamline jumping between them, preserve unsaved work, and respect fine-grained permission boundaries that determine which users can view or act on a given property.

- Launch switching from sidebar, command palette, or global search
- Display pending tasks and alerts for the destination property
- Enforce RBAC rules and require elevated approval when necessary

## Access Control

**Status:** In Development

Teams require granular visibility controls, particularly when properties are operated by different brands or management companies. The modern access control center will bundle role templates, fine-grained permissions, and change audits so administrators can delegate safely.

- Opinionated role presets for core hospitality departments
- Custom permission scopes across modules and actions
- Automatic audit logs for every permission update

## System Logs

**Status:** In Development

- Export and webhook delivery for external analytics platforms

## Channel Sync

- Activity feed showing pushes, pulls, and errors

## Linked Instances

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Istanze Collegate

Multi-property operators often sync rates or room allocations between sites. The linked instances module will define how data replicates, what should stay isolated, and how conflicts are resolved when two properties update the same record.

- Configure hub-and-spoke or peer replication rules
- Choose which entities sync (rates, inventory, guests, etc.)
- Review change history and resolve conflicts gracefully

## Cards & Credentials

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Tessere

The modern credential vault will let staff issue room keys, spa passes, or partner loyalty cards without juggling separate systems. Tight integration with access control ensures credentials inherit the correct permissions.

## Front Desk Command Center

**Status:** In Development
