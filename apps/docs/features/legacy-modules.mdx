Welcome to the running log of features that are being rebuilt for Nexora. Each entry summarizes the modernized workflow and calls out when the surface is still under construction.

## License Management

**Status:** In Development  
**Legacy Name:** Licenza

Nexora will provide a centralized license registry that captures property license numbers, issuing authorities, and renewal cadence per accommodation. The placeholder surface in the application ensures navigation parity while the full workflow—notifications, document storage, and compliance auditing—is delivered.

- Track license metadata per property or brand
- Schedule renewal reminders with escalation paths
- Attach supporting compliance documentation for quick audits

<Info>
The new experience is shipping incrementally. Until the full workflow is ready, admins should continue to maintain official records in their existing system.
